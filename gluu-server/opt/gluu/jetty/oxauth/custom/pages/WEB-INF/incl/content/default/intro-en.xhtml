    This service uses secure 2-factor authentication to secure your account.
  </p>
    <p>You can set up your mobile device (smartphone or tablet) to serve as a second factor, or you can use a FIDO ("Fast Identity Online") Universal Second Factor (U2F) security key.</p>

                <summary>What is 2-factor authentication?</summary>
                <p>
          2-factor authentication is a way to confirm users by using a combination of two different factors:
        </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>something they know</b>
                        (for example a password)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>something they have</b>
                        (a physical object)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Think of it like a locked door that can only be opened with both a key and a secret code on a keypad.
          Someone pretending to be you should never be able to get both those things.</p>
                <p>You can set up your mobile device (smartphone or tablet) to serve
        as a second factor, or you can use a FIDO U2F security key (a special
        hardware security device that fits in the USB port of your
        computer).</p>
                <p>FIDO U2F security keys are available for purchase online. 
          If you donâ€™t have a smartphone or tablet then this is your best option.</p>
